                        This Privacy Policy applies to all information we collect through our web applications from Crowdpac users, including you. When you are no longer a Crowdpac user, we will continue to share your information as described in this policy. This policy only applies to your use of Crowdpac and does not apply to the practices or service of any payment processing service used by you through Crowdpac’s web applications.

                    <p>
                        Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been aggregated and/or anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user. Crowdpac will own such aggregated and anonymized information.

                        Identification Information - your full name, mailing address, email address, and date of birth. If you desire to make a political contribution or pledge using the Crowdpac Platform, we also will require you to give us your occupation and the name of your employer. Crowdpac will comply with the requirements of the US Social Security Administration with respect to the secure storage of your Social Security Number. For a Registered Campaign, we collect such identification information about the authorized officer associated with such campaign (usually its Treasurer) and the Federal Election Commission Identification Number assigned to such campaign.

For a PAC, we collect such identification information about the authorized officer associated with such committee (usually its Treasurer) and the Federal Election Commission Identification Number assigned to such PAC.

                    <p>
                        Device Information - information about you: (a) from your mobile device such as your device type, machine or mobile device identification number, media access control address, geo-location, time zone, language setting, browser type, and IP address, and (b) from third parties for purposes of transaction processing, identity verification, fraud detection or prevention and other similar purposes.

                    <p>
                        Before permitting you to use or to continue using Crowdpac, we may require additional information from you that we can use to verify your identity or other information or to manage risk and compliance throughout our relationship. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification, fraud prevention and similar service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you are using Crowdpac, we collect information about your Crowdpac activity, including your contribution, pledge and messaging history and your interests in political and social causes. We also may collect information about your mobile device, computer or other access device for fraud prevention and other similar purposes.

                    <p>
                        When you make a contribution using Crowdpac, your designated preferred funding source (either your bank account and routing number or your debit and credit card) will be shared with Crowdpac’s payment processing service provider. Crowdpac, however, will not have full visibility of such information and will not store such financial information. We will collect information about your contribution and pledge amounts and the recipients of your contributions and pledges and will assign you a rating based on your contribution and pledge history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contacts with us.

                    <p>When you visit our website or use the Crowdpac Platform, we may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, "Cookies"). We use Cookies to recognize you as a Crowdpac user; customize Crowdpac for your use, customize other content and contribution opportunities for you; measure the effectiveness of our profiling of Crowdpac users; perform a wide range of analytics; mitigate risk and prevent potential fraud; and to promote trust and safety across our sites and the Crowdpac Platform. </p>
                    <p>Certain aspects and features of the Crowdpac Platform and our website are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you choose to disable or decline Cookies, your use of the Crowdpac Platform may be limited or not possible.</p>
                    <p>We, or a data provider we have engaged, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads, content or services. No personally identifiable information is placed into these cookies. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies or learn more please go to <a class="rclst" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</a> </p>
                    <p>Additionally, emails we send may contain a bit of code known as a "web beacon." This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website. Our web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.” </p>
                    <p>Do Not Track: Do Not Track ("DNT") is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. We do not track users unless they enable the “remember me” feature on the Crowdpac signup page, in which case we store their email/username using browser cookies. If you set DNT, then you will be unable to utilize the “remember me” feature for future log-ins to Crowdpac. </p>
