                        Crowdpacâ€™s mission is to make it easier for people to participate in politics, run for office, and to support candidates and causes that match their priorities and beliefs. We want to help end the stranglehold of big money donors and special interests on the political system.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 2rem">
                        We try to deliver on this mission through different products: crowdfunding tools to help people run for office for the first time, tools for organizations to grow their donor base, and conditional pledging to hold politicians accountable.
