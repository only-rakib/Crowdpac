Reasons for further identity verification include suspicious activity involving a Constituent’s Crowdpac Account, any indication that a Constituent may not be who he or she states, and any indication that a Constituent may be a foreign national. Crowdpac also will require further identity verification if an Authorized Recipient or any governmental authority requests that a Constituent’s identity be verified.

                    </p>
                    <p>A Constituent may use the Crowdpac Platform (i) to make a one-time campaign contribution in a specified amount to an Authorized Recipient, (ii) to make a commitment to an Authorized Recipient that he or she will make regular, periodic contributions in specified amounts and at specified times, which contribution commitments may be conditioned on the candidate associated with the Authorized Recipient maintaining specified ratings, (iii) to pledge to an Authorized Recipient or to an Unauthorized Recipient (or to a Future Nominee) that he or she intends to make one or more contributions to it, which contributions may be conditioned on the candidate associated with the Registered Campaign maintaining specified ratings or receiving the public endorsement of a specified endorsing organization, and (iv) to make Earmarked Contributions to Future Nominees.&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggregate amount that a Constituent may contribute to a particular Authorized Recipient is limited by federal election law, presently $2,800 to each Registered Campaign for each election, $35,500 to each Registered National Party Committee during each calendar year, and $5,000 to PACs that are SSFs or unconnected PACs (unlimited for Super PACs) during each calendar year.&nbsp; In addition, Leadership PACs are limited to $5,000 in contributions to a Registered Campaign per election.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pledges and Earmarked Contributions count as contributions made for purposes of such limits (e.g., an outstanding $500 pledge to a Registered Campaign or a $500 Earmarked Contribution to a Future Nominee reduces the potential amount of other contributions that the Constituent may make to such Registered Campaign during the election from $2,800 to $2,300).

                    </ul>
                    <p>For the purposes of this Agreement a one-time contribution is defined as a one-time transfer of money from a Constituent to an Authorized Recipient. A Constituent will not be permitted to make one-time contributions to Unauthorized Recipients using the Crowdpac Platform; instead, the Crowdpac Platform will treat a Constituent’s attempt to make a contribution to an Unauthorized Recipient as such Constituent’s intent to make such contribution if and when the Unauthorized Recipient becomes an Authorized Recipient.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periodic Contributions
                    </p>
                    <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, a periodic contribution is defined as a commitment to transfer money from a Constituent to an Authorized Recipient&nbsp;in the future at specific times and in specific amounts (which may vary) pursuant to a predetermined schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;Periodic contributions will be withdrawn by Crowdpac for the benefit of the Authorized Recipient&nbsp;from a Constituent’s designated preferred funding source as previously provided to Crowdpac in accordance with the specified schedule unless the Constituent changes, alters, or cancels the scheduled contribution or the Authorized Recipient withdraws or otherwise ceases to be active.&nbsp;&nbsp;A periodic contribution may be conditioned on the candidate associated with a Registered Campaign maintaining an active campaign.
                    </p>
                    <p>As stated above in Part II.F.2.i, the Crowdpac Platform will treat a Constituent’s attempt to make a one-time contribution to an Unauthorized Recipient using the Crowdpac Platform as such Constituent’s conditional commitment to make such contribution if and when the Unauthorized Recipient becomes an Authorized Recipient.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of such conditioned contribution will be withdrawn by Crowdpac for the benefit of the Authorized Recipient&nbsp;from a Constituent’s designated preferred funding source as previously provided to Crowdpac if and when the Unauthorized Recipient becomes an Authorized Recipient unless the Constituent changes, alters, or cancels the intended contribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pledges
                    </p>
                    <p>Pledges may be made to (1) Authorized Recipients, (2) Unauthorized Recipients conditioned upon them becoming Authorized Recipients, and (3) authorized campaigns of Future Nominees conditioned upon them satisfying certain&nbsp;requirements (such as maintaining specified ratings or receiving the public endorsement of a specified endorsing organization) and&nbsp;becoming Authorized Recipients.
                    </p>
                    <p>A pledged contribution is a promise of a future contribution of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pledges may be conditioned on the candidate associated with a campaign maintaining or achieving a specified rating by a particular issue advocacy organization within a specific period of time or satisfying by a specified date the condition(s) established for a candidate to receive Earmarked Contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the candidate associated with a campaign successfully maintains or achieves the specified rating or receives the public endorsement of the specified endorsing organization, the Constituent will be notified and given the opportunity to make the pledged contribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pledges must be made for a specific amount, with every intention of the Constituent to pay the stated amount in its entirety.&nbsp;&nbsp;All primary election pledges must be made on or before the day of the primary election.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pledges are built into a contributor's aggregate contribution total.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Conditioning Your Pledges</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Constituents may condition their pledges to a campaign (including the authorized campaign of a Future Nominee) by requiring that the candidate associated with a campaign (i) maintain or obtain at least a designated rating by a recognized third-party organization or special interest group that routinely and publicly rates candidates and elected officials with respect to their views and voting history on specific political issues or causes or (ii) satisfy by a specified date the condition(s) established for receiving Earmarked Contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Constituent requires a candidate to maintain or obtain a certain rating or to satisfy the condition(s) established for receiving Earmarked Contributions as a condition to such candidate’s campaign receiving a future contribution, Crowdpac will determine whether that candidate has or has not satisfied that condition and notify the Constituent of such determination before processing the conditioned contribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowdpac, however, is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, reliability, timeliness or frequency of any rating or endorsement of a candidate.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Constituent may change the required rating or endorsement or cancel a contribution commitment or pledge at any time before the conditioned contribution is made.&nbsp;&nbsp;In absence of a preexisting rating for a particular candidate, Crowdpac will assign such candidate a C rating on a letter grade scale or a numerical rating of a 50 on a 1 to 100 number scale.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Pledge Limit; Constituent Ratings</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the number of pledges a Constituent makes using the Crowdpac Platform as well as the amount of those pledges. If we have authenticated your identity and your designated preferred funding source and you have honored your commitments and pledges, we may increase your pledge limit. If you fail to honor your contribution commitments and pledges, we may restrict your ability to make contribution commitments and pledges using the Crowdpac Platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earmarked Contributions.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, an Earmarked Contribution is defined as a one-time transfer of money from a Constituent to an Earmark Account established by Crowdpac to hold contributions from Constituents that are earmarked for a Future Nominee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Earmarked Contributions may be made only to the authorized campaigns of Future Nominees conditioned upon them satisfying by a specified date the condition(s) established for them to receive such Earmarked Contributions and becoming Authorized Recipients or to the designated default recipient if no candidate satisfies such condition(s).&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constituent that solicits Earmarked Contributions for a specified Future Nominee or that formed the Group on Crowdpac for purposes of making such solicitations must clearly identify in such solicitation (1) the Future Nominee by office sought, party affiliation and election cycle, (2) any condition(s) that must be satisfied by a candidate in order for such candidate to qualify to receive the Earmarked Contributions for such Future Nominee, which may include the public endorsement of such candidate by a specified endorsing organization, (3) the specific time and date by when such Future Nominee must be determined, and (4) the default recipient of the Earmarked Contributions (which also must be an Authorized Recipient such as a Registered National Party Committee) if the conditions for determining the Future Nominee are not met by such specified date.&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfying such solicitation requirements allows Crowdpac to clearly identify the Future Nominee and the default recipient.
                    </p>
                    <p>Crowdpac will not exercise any discretion or control over the choice of the Authorized Recipient that receives such Earmarked Contributions, including the default recipient, or over the satisfaction of any imposed conditions. Crowdpac will determine whether a candidate has or has not satisfied the condition(s) relating to the Earmarked Contributions and notify the Constituent of such determination before processing the Earmarked Contributions.
                    </p>
                    <p>If a condition to receiving Earmarked Contributions is the public endorsement of the candidate by a specified endorsing organization, such endorsement must be a formal statement of support or approval by on behalf of a qualified endorsing organization that encourages voters to support a single, specified candidate for a specific office that appears in a newspaper or magazine article, a transcript from a television show, a press release, or any publicly available website.&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified endorsing organizations include recognized media outlets with a history of making political endorsements, organizations registered with the IRS under Section 501(c)(4) or Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, and Registered National Party Committees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowdpac is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, reliability, timeliness or frequency of any endorsement of a candidate.
                    </p>
                    <p>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Sharing Your Contribution History</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Authorized Recipient receiving your contribution will list your contribution in its required FEC reporting in accordance with federal election law.

                    </p>
                    <p>When you make a contribution to an Authorized Recipient, you are providing Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider with an authorization to process your contribution using your designated preferred funding source. Crowdpac’s third-party payment processing services provider will initiate a transfer of funds from your designated preferred funding source to your Constituent Account.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your contribution will be held as pending in your Constituent Account until Crowdpac processes it, which may not occur immediately depending on the Constituent, the Authorized Recipient or Future Nominee, or the amount of the contribution. In such cases, your authorization will remain valid for up to thirty (30) days although Crowdpac either will validate or reject your contribution within ten (10) days after your Constituent Account was credited with the amount of your intended contribution. Once your contribution is validated by Crowdpac, Crowdpac’s third-party payment processing services provider will initiate a transfer of funds from your account to the bank account registered with Crowdpac by the Authorized Recipient or to the Earmarked Account associated with the Future Nominee and then ultimately to the bank account registered with Crowdpac by the Authorized Recipient.&nbsp;&nbsp;For contribution commitments and pledges, we may request an authorization for what you estimate to be your entire contribution amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Constituent may cancel a contribution commitment (including an Earmarked Contribution) or pledge at any time before the scheduled contribution is actually transferred to the Authorized Recipient’s bank account or to the Earmarked Account.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a contribution is transferred to an Authorized Recipient’s bank account or to an Earmarked Account, the contribution cannot be reversed by the Constituent using the Crowdpac Platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Constituent must contact the Authorized Recipient regarding any requested refund of a contribution to such Authorized Recipient, which refund is in the sole discretion of the Authorized Recipient, or Crowdpac regarding any requested refund of an Earmarked Contribution, which refund request will be timely processed by Crowdpac.

                    <p>You may make contributions using the Crowdpac Platform with a bank account, debit card or credit card, and may designated one of these to be your preferred funding source.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make a contribution to an Authorized Recipient or to an Earmarked Account through the Crowdpac Platform, Crowdpac or its third-party payment processing services provider will withdraw funds from your designated preferred funding source to make the contribution in its entirety.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you use a credit card or debit card to make a contribution, you will be charged the standard 2.9% fee plus $0.20 per transaction charged by Crowdpac’s third-party payment processing services provider.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be notified of this charge before you complete your credit card or debit card transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;This charge will be in addition to and will not reduce the amount of your intended contribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will pay no fee or charge when your contribution is funded through an ACH bank account transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding Source Limitations
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to manage risk, Crowdpac may limit the funding sources available for your use to fund any particular contribution. For example, your funding sources for a particular contribution may be limited to your bank account.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please note that the various funding sources have different dispute resolution rights and procedures in the event your transaction turns out to be unsatisfactory. Your dispute resolution rights are determined by the funding source used to fund your transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank Transfers
                    </p>
                    <p>When your bank account is used as your funding source, you are requesting that Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider initiate on your behalf an electronic transfer from your bank account. For these transactions, Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider will make electronic transfers (via the Automated Clearing House (“<strong>ACH</strong>”) of NACHA - The Electronic Payment Association (“<strong>NACHA</strong>”)) from your bank account in the amount you specify. You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider to make the ACH transfer, and once you have provided your authorization for the transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer and Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider may resubmit any ACH debit you authorized that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds, except as otherwise provided by NACHA’s ACH rules (collectively, the “<strong>ACH Rules</strong>”), or applicable law.
                    </p>
                    <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debit Card Processing
                    </p>
                    <p>Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider will process your debit card-funded transactions through either the debit card’s ATM debit network or the Visa/MasterCard network, as Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider may elect at its discretion.
                    </p>
                    <p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit Card Information
                    </p>
                    <p>If your credit card account number changes or your credit card expiration date changes, we may acquire that information from our payment processing services provider and update your account accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refused and Refunded Transactions
                    </p>
                    <p>When you make a contribution, the Authorized Recipient that received your contribution is not required to accept it and may refund it even if it was accepted. You agree that you will not hold Crowdpac LLC liable for any damages resulting from a decision by an Authorized Recipient not to accept or to refund your contribution made through the Crowdpac Platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>If an Authorized Recipient to which you make a contribution through the Crowdpac Platform does not accept your contribution or elects to refund your contribution, then if the Authorized Recipient has not transferred your contribution from its Committee Account to its bank account, Crowdpac’s third-party payment processing services provider will cancel or reverse your contribution and will return your contribution, without reduction for Crowdpac’s 3% per transaction processing fee, to your Constituent Account.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Authorized Recipient has transferred your contribution from its Committee Account to its bank account before it determined that it is unable to accept your contribution or elected to refund your contribution, the Authorized Recipient will be responsible for returning your contribution to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowdpac’s 3% per transaction fee paid by the Authorized Recipient is nonrefundable once the Authorized Recipient transfers your contribution from its Committee Account to its bank account.
                    </p>
                    <p>Until the Authorized Recipient transfers your contribution from its Committee Account to its bank account, a hold may be placed on your contribution and Crowdpac’s 3% per transaction fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided the Authorized Recipient has not transferred your contribution from its Committee Account to its bank account, we will return any refused or refunded contribution to you through the Crowdpac Platform promptly after the Authorized Recipient informs Crowdpac of its election not to accept or to refund your contribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Fees for Making Contributions and Using the Crowdpac Platform</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>When a credit card or debit card is used to make a contribution to an Authorized Recipient, a Constituent will be charged the standard 2.9% fee plus $0.20 per transaction charged by Crowdpac’s third-party payment processing services provider.&nbsp;&nbsp;This charge will be in addition to and will not reduce the amount of your intended contribution. There is no fee or charge payable by a Constituent when his or her contribution is funded through an ACH bank account transfer. There also is no fee or charge payable by a Constituent when his or her contribution is transferred to an Authorized Recipient;&nbsp;instead, the Authorized Recipient&nbsp;receiving such contribution&nbsp;will pay Crowdpac a fee equal to 3% of the transferred amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>When funds for a Constituent’s contribution are transferred from a Constituent Account to an Authorized Recipient’s Committee Account via the Crowdpac Platform, the Authorized Recipient&nbsp;receiving such contribution&nbsp;will pay Crowdpac a fee equal to 3% of the transferred amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees paid to Crowdpac by each Authorized Recipient are in consideration of the overall benefits received by such Authorized Recipient from its use of the Crowdpac Platform and are considered by Crowdpac to be commercially reasonable and fair value for such use.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the FEC has advised Crowdpac that it is not making an in-kind contribution to any Authorized Recipient under 11 CFR 100.52(d).
                    </p>
                    <p>These fees may change from time to time in Crowdpac’s sole discretion. You also may be subject to third party fees, such as insufficient fund fees, reversal fees, or ACH insufficient fund fees that a bank may charge if a contribution is rejected.
                    </p>
                    <p>J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Payment Investigation</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>Payment investigation is a process by which Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions. If a contribution is subject to payment investigation, Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider will place a hold on the contribution and may provide notice to the Authorized Recipient. Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider will conduct a review and either clear or cancel the contribution. If the contribution is cleared, Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider will provide notice to the Authorized Recipient. Otherwise, Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider will cancel the contribution and the funds will be returned to the Constituent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowdpac will provide notice to the Constituent by email and/or in the account history tab of his or her Crowdpac Account if the contribution is canceled.
                    </p>
                    <p>K.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Item Hold</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on a contribution you make using the Crowdpac Platform when Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider believes there may be a high level of risk associated with the transaction. If Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider places a hold on your contribution, it will show as “pending” in your Crowdpac Account.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we receive a dispute, claim, chargeback, or reversal on the contribution subject to the hold, Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider will release the payment hold if Crowdpac or its payment processing services provider receives acceptable confirmation, is able to confirm proper delivery, or otherwise completes its investigation.
                    </p>
                    <p>L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Risk of Reversals</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>When an Authorized Recipient receives a contribution via the Crowdpac Platform, it is liable to the Constituent for the full amount of the contribution plus any fees payable by the Authorized Recipient if the contribution is later invalidated or refunded for any reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that, in addition to any other liability, an Authorized Recipient will be responsible for the amount of the contribution, plus applicable fees, if there is a reversal or refund of the contribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Authorized Recipient agrees to allow Crowdpac to recover any amounts due to Crowdpac from such Authorized Recipient.&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowdpac will contact the Authorized Recipient to recover the funds from the Authorized Recipient, and may take other legal actions to collect the amount due, to the extent allowed by applicable law.
                    </p>
                    <p>If a Constituent disputes a contribution made using the Crowdpac Platform or files a claim for a chargeback, the debit or credit card issuer or the originating bank, not Crowdpac, will determine whether the dispute is valid and to whom payment is due.
                    </p>
                    <p>M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Account Reviews</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>We review account and contribution activity at various times, including when a Constituent initiates a transfer of funds. This review checks for, among other things, suspicious or illegal activity, and whether your account activity complies with this Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>Reviews may result in:
                    </p>
                    <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delayed, blocked or cancelled contributions;

                    </p>
                    <p>Among other reasons, we may take the above actions if a Constituent knowingly or unknowingly made a contribution from a stolen card or compromised bank account.
                    </p>
                    <p>In connection with our review process, you may be required to provide us with additional information and/or documentation to verify your identity. We may limit or suspend your access to your Crowdpac Account until verification is completed.

                    <p>You may not close your Crowdpac Account to evade a payment investigation. If you attempt to close your Crowdpac Account while we are conducting an investigation, we may suspend your Crowdpac Account to protect Crowdpac or a third party against the risk of reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability. You will remain liable for all obligations related to your Crowdpac Account even after your Crowdpac Account is closed.

                    <p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolution Procedures for Unauthorized Contributions and Other Errors</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>The following terms and conditions apply with respect to all uses of the Crowdpac Platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unauthorized Contributions and Other Errors
                    </p>
                    <p>When an Unauthorized Contribution (defined below) or Other Error (defined below) occurs in your account, including Unauthorized Contributions that occur because your Crowdpac mobile-activated phone has been lost or stolen, Crowdpac will assist you in notifying the Registered Campaign, Registered National Party Committee or PAC of such Unauthorized Contribution or Other Error and requesting that the full amount of your Unauthorized Contribution or Other Error be refunded to you as long as you follow the procedures discussed below.&nbsp;&nbsp;As provided below in Section III.P (No Liability of Crowdpac for Contribution Failures), Section III.Q (Disclaimers of Warranty; Damages Exclusions) and Section III.R (Limitations on Liability), Crowdpac’s liability for Unauthorized Contributions and Other Errors, and to users of Crowdpac in general, is limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
                    </p>
                    <p>An&nbsp;<strong>“Unauthorized&nbsp;</strong><strong>Contribution”</strong>&nbsp;is a type of error that occurs when money is sent from your funding source that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you. For example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your account, and sends a contribution from your funding source, an Unauthorized Contribution has occurred. However, if you give someone access to your account (for example, by giving them your login information) and they conduct transactions without your knowledge or permission, you are responsible for any resulting use. Such transactions are not considered Unauthorized Contributions.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition,&nbsp;<strong>“Other Errors”</strong>&nbsp;occur when contributions are incorrectly recorded in your account. Routine inquiries about your contributions or the status of a pending contribution are not considered Unauthorized Contributions or Other Errors unless you expressly notify us of an Unauthorized Contribution or Other Error in connection with the contribution. Requests for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes and requests for duplicate documentation also are not deemed to be Unauthorized Contributions or Other Errors. You may request documentation or information regarding your Crowdpac Account to determine whether an Unauthorized Contribution or Other Error exists by contacting us through the “Contact Us” link on the Crowdpac website.
                    </p>
                    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification Requirements
                    </p>
                    <p>You should immediately notify Crowdpac if you believe:
                    </p>
                    <p>You should regularly log into your Crowdpac Account and review your contribution history to ensure that there has not been an Unauthorized Contribution or Other Error.&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowdpac will also send an email to your primary email address on file in order to notify you of each contribution you make.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should review those emails to ensure that each contribution was authorized and is accurate.
                    </p>
                    <p>For Unauthorized Contributions or Other Errors in your Crowdpac Account, notify us as follows:

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your name, and the email address and phone number registered to your Crowdpac Account;

                    </p>
                    <p>This User Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to conflict of law provisions, except to the extent that federal law applies.
                    </p>
                    <p>ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS USER AGREEMENT MUST BE ASSERTED INDIVIDUALLY IN BINDING ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR WITH EXPERIENCE IN CONSUMER ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICES DISPUTES ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE AAA SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES. The forum for arbitration shall be in the city closest to your residence having a federal district courthouse. The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. To the extent allowed by applicable law, the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this User Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this User Agreement is void or voidable. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any non-frivolous claim, Crowdpac will pay the costs of the arbitration (but not your attorney fees), up to $3,000.
                    </p>
                    <p>This User Agreement and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the United States Arbitration Act shall apply in all cases and govern the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are only two exceptions to this agreement to arbitrate. First, if we reasonably believe that you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. Second, any claim of $500 or less may, at the option of the claiming party, be resolved in small claims court in Washington, D.C., if the claim and the parties are within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. For these two exceptions, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the District of Columbia for the purpose of litigating such claims or disputes.
